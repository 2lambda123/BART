-----------------------------------------------------------------
### Meeting on 2017/06/29

To cover at this and subsequent meeting:
- Goals of the project: near-, mid-, and long-term
- Structure of project
  - language(s)
  - third party libraries
  - testing framework
  - build system
  - documentation
  - style guide
- Collaboration / interaction plan
- License
- Anything else?

#### Goals
**near-term**
- research tool to investigate one or two transport method(s)
- spatial solver (2D or 3D?)
- access to nuclear data (via PyNE?)
Rudimentary ability for
- source specification
- geometry specification
- boundary conditions (vacuum only?)
- material assignment
- multiple energy groups


**mid-term**
- eigenvalue solver
- reflecting boundary conditions
- 3D

**long-term**
- plug-and-play research tool in which it is easy to add a new method and
  investigate how it interacts with a variety of already established methods
- 3D
- multiple boundary condition types
- multiple approaches for energy structure (?)
- versatile geometry (?)
- multiple solution methods
