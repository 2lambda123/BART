# DG-EP

We're implementing the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for the Even Parity
(EP) neutron transport equations in general dimensions (up to 3D). 
This is an initial setup and prototypical code with isotropic scattering.
The code is still in progress.

Currently, we are using [deal.II](http://www.dealii.org/) finite element
library. In the future, we are likely to convert to
[libMesh](http://libmesh.github.io/).
