05-04-2017:
1. Fixing bugs and adding AssertThrows for preprocessing modules
2. Implemented fission source calculations in parallel environment
3. Finishing up source_iteration () and power_iteration ()
4. Fixing output_results () s.t. the code can output MG fluxes

05-06-2017:
1. Fixed ho_solver () (HO solver); enable to use it for both symmetric
and asymmetric systems
2. adding method to initialize HO preconditioners with PETSc AMG

05-07~14-2017:
0. Revised PNE paper (invited as a special issue)
1. re-designed intaking and processing parameters
2. Fixed output_results

05-17-2017:
1. start to debug while fixing things up

05-22-2017:
1. fixed the way we generate the rhs
2. prepare for starting debugging (hopefully, we starts off on Wednesday.)

05-23-2017:
1. Fixed the material ID map input method
2. Fixed the transfer matrix inputing
3. Simplified one-group parameter parsing
4. The first ever input file composed.

05-25-2017:
1. started to debug

05-30-2017:
1. restructured the code so problem definition is taken care of individually.
2. The finite element part is written as a class derived from the problem definition
class.

06-21-2017:
1. DG-EP works, now the focus is turned to the mathematical side
2. MPI works
3. Input file system designed to take material configuration easily
4. Structure implemented to hopefully easy to add new methods in.
5. Prototypical ModelManager is designed to separate the model building
based on user input.
