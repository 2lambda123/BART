/*! \brief Interface for a system matrix stamper.
 *
 *  The system matrix and vectors represent the degrees of freedom for all the
 *  cells in the triangulation. This stamper class takes a cell- or cell-and-face-based function and fills the system
 *  matrix with the results of the function over all the cells in the triangulation. Another class provides a
 *  functional that will fill a matrix or vector for a given cell, this class then iterates over all
 *  cells and stamps the results onto the system matrix.
 *
 * \tparam dim spatial dimension of the cells in the mesh.
